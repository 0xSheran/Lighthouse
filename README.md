# **Lighthouse**

Lighthouse is a <ins>proof-of-contribution protocol</ins> for web3 reputation and credentialing. You can use it to capture interactions that occur across your decentralized community (like activity on Discord, participation in meetings, voting on proposals etc.) and attest them on-chain to make them transparent and immutable.

Lighthouse can also be used to <ins>score contributions</ins>. You can add members to a multi-sig so they can vote transparently on the value of each contribution based on criteria you or your community define. In Lighthouse, these members that form the multi-sig are called “stewards”.

Attestations can also be automated so stewards don’t need to manually attest contributions every time. Attestation automation is especially useful for contributions that represent objective, non-gameable events (such as adding liquidity to a dapp or voting on a proposal).

Attestations can then be used for <ins>reputation and credentialing</ins> within a DAO, but more generally across web3. When a contribution is recorded as an on-chain attestation, it is associated with a particular wallet address. Over time, this creates a trail of contributions that can be filtered and used for a wide variety of purposes.

For example, you could issue a NFT for level-based access, send non-transferrable governance-specific tokens, or simply issue treasury payments for completing a set of tasks.

Here are some benefits of using Lighthouse in your decentralized community:

1. **Consolidate your community’s contributions:** Replace tracking actions on spreadsheets with a robust tool that lets you evaluate, validate, score and filter all contributions from anyone in your community.
2. **Increase transparency:** Shed light on how your community works. Open access to members so they can see which members are contributing and how.
3. **Recognize contributors for creating value**: Incentivize participation through tokens, badges, credentialing and other forms of recognition and acknowledgement.
