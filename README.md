# Lighthouse
Lighthouse is a community-run web3 reputation and rewards platform.

## Introduction**

- Reputation plays an important role in how human societies organize and function. Good reputation is generally considered a valuable resource and often results in better than expected outcomes  for an individual. Reputation is based on a set of criteria related to observed behavior or performance.
- With the emergence of DAOs, much work has been done to create mechanisms of measuring reputation. Some of these include token-based reputation systems (e.g. governance tokens), community-voted reputation (e.g. Coordinape) and influence/contribution-based reputation (e.g. SourceCred, Colony). These mechanisms are mostly utilized for DAO specific functions such as meritocratic governance and treasury payouts. However, they are often isolated to specific communities or tools, and lack customization, interoperability and cannot be extended.
- Given the explosion of web3 and growing mainstream adoption, a robust tool that aggregates user reputation across chains, tools and communities could be beneficial to the entire ecosystem as well as individual projects.
- An aggregated reputation score offers the possibility to unlock varied features such as reputation-based loyalty schemes and marketing strategies (e.g. reputation-based NFTs, airdrops, “airdrips”, etc.) as well as DeFi applications (e.g. under collateralized loans, premium yields).
- However, none of these mechanisms exist today. To address this we created Lighthouse. Lighthouse brings a composable, cross-chain reputation system to web3.

## How it works**

- A user starts by connecting his/her wallet(s).
- Lighthouse crawls the wallet addresses and correlates activity to reputation. This is done through an expanding list of API integrations (e.g. Snapshot GraphQL API for governance, Etherscan API for transactions, Alchemy API for token balances, APIs from DAO spin up tools, etc.).
- Individual DAOs also have the ability to compose their own reputation scores depending on how they value each source of reputation. These scores can then be used by DAOs to incentivize participation, integrate with 3rd party tools or offer rewards such as reputation-based NFTs, airdrops, “airdrips”, preferential yields and under-collateralized loans.
- DAOs also have the ability to grant reputation for subjective or retrospective work.
- All reputation scores, opportunities and rewards are listed on lighthouse.xyz that also acts as a reference implementation of the underlying protocol and manages core Lighthouse activity.
- Lighthouse incentivizes users to connect multiple wallets to a single account. This allows users to accumulate more reputation and access better rewards.
- In order to prevent Sybil attacks, the same wallet cannot be connected to more than one account at a given time or used to unlock the same reward twice.

## Our vision**

- **Create a new form of credentialing based on reputation:** User-credentialing is a massive unsolved problem in web3 due to the rise of anonymity. Reputation based user-credentialing relies on trust through proven work, which is a significantly better approach to current invasive approaches.
- **Create better models of participation:** Today, power is heavily restricted to large governance token holders. Integrating reputation credentialing can lead to better participation, with value flowing back to human contribution.
- **Amplify growth through positive-sum behavior:** By introducing better models of participation, DAOs can create a cult of super-contributors, attract better brain power and strengthen the core community.
