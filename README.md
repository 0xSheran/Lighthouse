# Lighthouse
Lighthouse is the cross-chain reputation standard for DAO members

## **The Problem**
DAO tools are scattered, cross-competitive and track reputation in isolation. This limits connectivity and participation between DAOs and DAO members.

- **For DAOs:** Discovering top users and incentivizing them to participate requires cumbersome, manual work.

- **For DAO Members**: There’s no platform to centrally track DAO insights and activities. There's also no easy way to discover opportunities to contribute or signal interest in order to participate. Finally, existing reputation tracking mechanisms are limited to a particular DAO or DAO tool, lack portability and are not permanent.

## **The Solution**
Lighthouse empowers DAO workers by combining activity, opportunities and rewards. It consists of 3 main components:

1. **DAO Activity Tracker:**  A single place to track all the activity from all DAOs and discover opportunities to participate.

2. **Reputation Builder:** Aggregated scores that tracks reputation across various spheres of influence (such as “NFT Influence” and “DeFi Performance” and evolves as you engage more with DAOs.

3. **The Rewards Engine:** A series of incentive programs that DAOs make available to potential high value users in order to incentivize and retain them.

## **How it Works**
Whenever a user connects to the system, Lighthouse scans their wallet, discovers active DAOs and provides insights, analytics and opportunities for contribution.

The system also assigns various reputation scores based on previous aggregated activity.

Given the scattered nature of the DAO tooling ecosystem we believe that Lighthouse will provide better models of DAO-user discovery and collaboration.

## **Utility of the $LHT Token**
The protocol connects potential high value users with projects, and for facilitating this DAOs pay a commission on each claimed reward. Additionally, users receive $LHT for contributing to the protocol.
