# Lighthouse

On-chain scoring tailored to your community.

## Background

- The promise of a web3-native community is its ability to collaborate. This means diverse individuals work together to create positive-sum value;
- However, in order for web3 organizations to be successful in the long-term, they must transition away from pure financial incentivization to a more diverse way of distributing and signaling value;
- The true value of such a community cannot be measured by vanity metrics such as TVL or total wallet holders but by the people it attracts and their involvement;
- This can only be achieved with robust tools that capture value and in-turn facilitate better models of governance, rewards and credibility.

## The Problem

Most communities today simply do not have a good mechanism for qualifying and measuring  contribution. A variety of existing approaches exist already including:

- Custom solutions that are difficult to replicate and require a large amount of engineering effort to build;
- Monolithic reputation systems (such as Aragon or Colony reputation systems) that break when purpose built tools are adopted or;
- Siloed reputation systems (Coordinape, Source Cred, Praise etc.) that may be difficult to deploy and only capture part of the value created.

As a result, communities lean on native token-based incentive mechanisms, which misalign incentives for members:

- Loyalty is defined retrospectively and doesn’t account for future or long-term behavior;
- Financial incentives attracts the wrong kind of members (token farmers and Sybil attacks);
- Expensive way of discovering behaviors to incentivize;
- Discounts a love for community in favor of financial upside.

## Our Solution

Lighthouse solves this through a simple and robust on-chain points protocol that utilizes non-transferable tokens (known as “Lighthouse NTTs”) that can be distributed to anyone that creates value within a community.

This unlocks a variety of advantages from the get-go including:

- Speed to market through a fully decentralized, purpose-built score attribution mechanism that can be adopted by any community for any use case;
- Reduced pressure on token generation, lower incentives for bad actors (token farmers) and disincentivization of token dumping due to the decorrelation of immediate or premeditated monetary reward from contributions that create value;
- The ability to define or discover valuable behavior and reward users retrospectively while keeping the exact criteria secret;
- Promotes cross-collaboration through public and transparent NTT transaction logs;
- Creates better brand loyalty and top of mind recall because tokens are held in non-custodial wallets.

## Lighthouse NTTs - Features

1. ***Unlimited Supply:*** Scores decay naturally through inflation if members reduce engagement with your dapp or community;
2. ***Distribution Triggers:*** Automatically send tokens when conditions you define are met;
3. ***Subjective Attributions:*** Reward members for off-chain contributions like tweets, code merges, advice, activity in Discord or anything else you want to consider;
4. ***Decentralized Approval:*** Use a decentralized, permissioned whitelist to add or remove members that can attribute NTTs to other members;
5. ***Member-initiated Claims:*** Claims made by members are auto-validated, but you can challenge them to submit them to a vote or veto them outright;
6. ***Transaction Logs:*** Append custom metadata to logs and query or filter Lighthouse NTT transactions;
7. ***Community Leaderboard:*** Show your community a leaderboard and encourage wider participation;
8. ***Sybil Resistant:*** Disincentivize Sybil attacks by using NTTs as a proxy for value and reducing visibility on retrospective rewards criteria.
