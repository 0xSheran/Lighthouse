# Lighthouse
Lighthouse offers you a personalized view of high quality news, vetted rewards and governance initiatives for your favorite DAOs, crypto communities and projects.

## The Problem

- Over the last couple of years, web3 projects have exploded. Today, there are more than 4000 DAOs, $10B in treasuries and 1.6M governance token holders.
- Yet keeping track of web3 activity is extremely difficult. A typical user has to navigate between multiple platforms such as Discord, Twitter, Snapshot, Aragon and other custom built infrastructure just to stay up-to-date with a single community.
- Moreover, some of these tools (such as Discord and Twitter) are inundated with varying degrees of content quality resulting in wasted time and increased frustration as users need to wade through tedious amounts of unrelated information.
- This problem grows exponentially as the ecosystem matures due to the increased number of communities, tools, users and information.

## Existing Landscape

- Existing aggregation efforts (e.g. DeepDAO, Messari, etc.) focus largely on governance and treasury movements due to the inherent complexities of reading data from public information networks.
- As a result, these tools offer very little information on what actually goes on in a Web3 community and fail to track many emerging communities as they do not have a publicly listed token or a well-defined governance framework.
- As a result, information is limited, lacks user personalization and is presented in a format that is unactionable, uninsightful or irrelevant.
- Moreover, tools like Messari can cost upward of $6000 per annum for professional memberships, creating a barrier to entry for most users.

## Audience

- The increased explosion of web3, especially since 2017, has made tracking information increasingly difficult due to the sheer magnitude of tools, projects, platforms and technologies. The eco-system has also seen a wave of newer mainstream users that appreciate decentralized technologies but find web3 difficult to navigate or keep up with.
- Today, the typical user finds it arduous and frustrating to actively refer to Discord, Twitter, Snapshot, Aragon and the myriad other tools and platforms on which their communities are active. Moreover, most users are passive consumers of information, rarely posting on Discord, tweeting or voting.
- Lighthouse is made for this audience, and provides a personalized, consolidated experience for consuming information on web3.

## The solution

- Lighthouse is an intelligent, personalized web3 activity tracker.
- Any user can connect their wallet, discover communities they are active in (or wish to follow) and unlock a high-quality, vetted stream of ongoing activity with little effort.
- To do this, Lighthouse connects to multiple data sources through API integrations, vets information using a novel, decentralized approach and matches the end result with a user’s choices.
- The result is an intelligent, high-quality information feed directly personalized to a user.
- By filtering news and announcements, and combining it with user preferences, Lighthouse provides a far superior experience to any existing web3 community tracker.
- The goal of this project is to ultimately provide a complete and personalized view of a users’ web3 experience.
